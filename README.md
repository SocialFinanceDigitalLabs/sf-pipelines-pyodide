# 903 Pipeline Test

## Description

This project is a web application that uses PyScript to run the liia tools pipelines completely in the browser. This means that no installation is required and data is uploaded to anywhere. The only thing the user needs is a web browser and the files that need processing.

Currently, it only runs the 903 pipeline. Instead of using the liiatools directory, since some updates are still needed, it uses a testing python project adapted to work in pyodide, called `sf-pipelines-test2` - it doesn't have a repo because it's just a hacky solution for now.


To use this tool go to https://sfdl.org.uk/sf-pipelines-pyodide/ and follow the instructions. You can use [this sample files](/samples/).
